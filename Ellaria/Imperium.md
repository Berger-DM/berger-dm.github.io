# The Imperium of the Divine Ascendancy

A theocratic empire founded on the belief in a single, omnipotent god and the perfection of angelic beings. Its leaders claim divine mandate and seek to mold their people into paragons of perfection, often through brutal methods.

## Core Beliefs and Ideology

- **Monotheism and Divine Perfection**: The empire holds that their god is the one true deity, superior to all other deities, and that it is the duty of mortals to strive for ascension through devotion, discipline, and sacrifice.
- **Worship of Angels**: The angels who fought in the world’s past wars are seen as paragons of divine perfection. The Imperium believes that these angels should serve as role models for all people, and their angelic regalia are used to graft parts of their bodies onto the empire’s most devoted warriors to make them stronger.
- **Corruption of Flesh**: The Imperium has adopted a practice of **biomechanical prosthetics**, where parts of the "angelic regalia" are integrated into their bodies, granting them enhanced strength, agility, and magical abilities. This is a sign of devotion, and the more angelic remnants a warrior bears, the more revered they are.
- **Heavenly Ascension**: The Imperium teaches that through devotion and perfection, mortals can ascend to a state of celestial purity, either in body or spirit, ultimately becoming like the angels that fought in the world’s wars.

## Political Structure

- **The Divine Emperor/Empress**: The head of the Imperium, believed to be the living voice of the omnipotent god, and the highest authority in both religious and political matters. The ruler is chosen from the most devout of the aristocracy and is often seen as a divine vessel.
- **The Ecclesiarchs**: A group of high-ranking religious leaders, each of whom oversees a specific region of the empire. They are responsible for ensuring that the Imperium’s teachings and practices are strictly followed. Ecclesiarchs wield significant political power and often serve as advisors to the Divine Emperor.
- **The Ascendant Legion**: An elite military group composed of the most powerful and angelically augmented warriors. These warriors are the empire’s enforcers, tasked with ensuring the will of the Divine Emperor is carried out, and they are feared across the land.
- **The Angelic Choir**: A group of high-ranking religious scholars and mystics who serve as both advisers to the Divine Emperor and keepers of the sacred knowledge of the angels. They are tasked with interpreting ancient texts and unlocking the mysteries of the angelic regalia.
- **The Acolytes**: Rank-and-file members of the Imperium’s clergy, these individuals are charged with spreading the teachings of the Divine Ascendancy throughout the empire and beyond. They serve as missionaries, indoctrinating others into the faith.

## Society and Culture

- **Devotion to Perfection**: Society within the Imperium revolves around the pursuit of perfection. Citizens are expected to follow strict codes of conduct and undergo constant self-discipline, both in mind and body.
- **Angel Augmentation**: The practice of grafting angelic body parts onto oneself is not just limited to the military; many of the wealthiest and most influential individuals in the empire undergo the process to gain power and status. This has created a deep social divide, with those who have been augmented seen as “closer to perfection.”
- **Religious Zealotry**: The people of the Imperium are fervently religious, with each day dedicated to rituals, prayers, and acts of devotion to the god. Their faith is their strength, and they view those outside the empire as misguided and lesser.
- **Suppression of Free Will**: The state enforces a rigid structure, and anyone who questions the doctrines or refuses to augment themselves is seen as a traitor. The penalty for defiance can be harsh—exile, imprisonment, or even execution. Freedom of thought is seen as anathema to the pursuit of perfection.
- **Martial Glory**: Honor is heavily tied to martial ability and the ability to demonstrate one's devotion through physical prowess. Warriors who undergo augmentation are venerated as heroes, and their actions are celebrated through grand monuments and public ceremonies.

## Key Institutions

- **The Basilica of Ascension**: The largest and most sacred temple in the empire, located at the heart of the capital. It is here that the most sacred rites take place, and it serves as a center for the study of angelic remnants and divine teachings.
- **The Forge of Perfection**: A secretive, heavily guarded facility where angelic prosthetics are made and where the most skilled artisans and engineers work to craft new augmentations. This is a place of both great reverence and immense fear, as it represents the deepest connection between the mortal realm and the divine.
- **The Order of the Shattered Wing**: A secretive and shadowy group within the Imperium, believed to be the enforcers of the empire’s darker laws. They hunt down dissenters and traitors, using their influence and power to eliminate any threat to the Divine Ascendancy.

## Military and Warfare

- **The Ascendant Legion**: A powerful army composed of elite warriors who have undergone angelic augmentation. These soldiers are seen as the ultimate defenders of the empire, wielding divine power and unmatched strength in battle. Their tactics are ruthless, and they show no mercy to those who oppose them.
- **The Holy Crusaders**: A group of religious zealots who fight not just for land, but for the purity of the faith. These warriors believe that any battle fought in the name of their god is a righteous crusade, and they often lead the charge into enemy territories.
- **The Winged Sentinels**: A specialized unit of aerial warriors who use enchanted, mechanical wings or other forms of flight to scout, raid, and attack from above. Their wings are often made from angelic remnants, giving them a divine grace in the air.

## The Empire's Goals and Expansion

- **Spread of the Divine Ascendancy**: The Imperium seeks to bring the entire world under the rule of their god, believing that all nations must accept the divine truths they hold. They view any resistance to their rule as heresy and strive to convert or destroy those who defy them.
- **Harvesting Angelic Remnants**: The empire is always seeking new sources of angelic regalia, whether through war or finding ancient sites of celestial battles. These remains are key to their military strength and their ability to augment their most devoted followers.
- **Cleansing of Heresy**: The Imperium views itself as the sole bastion of truth in a world filled with false religions and gods. They aim to root out any form of heresy or rebellion, whether it comes from neighboring kingdoms or internal factions.
- **Perfection Through War**: The Imperium believes that war and conflict are essential for spiritual and societal growth. Each battle is seen as a test of devotion and a step toward achieving divine perfection.
