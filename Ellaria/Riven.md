## The Riven Shards

## 1. Veylan – The Gilded Throne

- **Identity**: A city of old nobility and wealth, once the heart of Riven’s aristocracy. Many noble families remain, clinging to the idea of restoring the old kingdom.
- **Conflict**: Bitterly divided between those who want to reclaim Riven’s past glory and those who wish to forge a new path. They see themselves as the rightful leaders of the Shards, but their arrogance alienates others.
- **Potential Alliances**: Could attempt to unify the Shards under a centralized monarchy, but their elitism creates resentment.

## 2. Drakenvold – The Oathbreakers’ Bastion

- **Identity**: A city that sided with the Imperium during the war, betraying Riven. When the Imperium abandoned them after the conquest, they were left to fend for themselves.
- **Conflict**: Loathed by other city-states as traitors, Drakenvold struggles to prove its loyalty. Some factions wish to align with the Imperium again, while others seek redemption.
- **Potential Alliances**: They could offer military expertise and knowledge of Imperium tactics, but few trust them.

## 3. Redwater – The River Wardens

- **Identity**: Controlling the most vital river crossings and ports, Redwater thrives on trade and war logistics. The city's wealth comes from its ability to dictate the flow of goods, soldiers, and mercenaries.
- **Conflict**: Redwater’s leaders are torn between siding with a single faction or continuing to profit by keeping the Shards divided. Some believe securing a unified Riven would be more lucrative in the long term, but others refuse to relinquish their control over trade.
- **Potential Alliances**: They hold the key to supply chains, making them a crucial player in any power struggle.

## 4. Ashenhold – The Devout’s Reckoning

- **Identity**: A city ruled by zealots who defected to the Imperium but later turned against them, believing the Imperium to be corrupt in its faith.
- **Conflict**: Locked in a religious civil war between those who still seek Imperium favor and those who want to establish their own divine authority.
- **Potential Alliances**: Could be a dangerous but useful ally against the Imperium—if their fanaticism can be controlled.

## 5. Redmarche – The Mercenary Lords

- **Identity**: Once a warrior’s city, Redmarche is now ruled by those who thrive on commerce and hired blades. Power is dictated by wealth, and every army in Riven has had dealings with its merchants.
- **Conflict**: The city’s elite are split—some wish to form a disciplined army to reclaim Riven, while others believe profit should dictate who they serve.
- **Potential Alliances**: Redmarche sells its allegiance to the highest bidder, making it both an invaluable asset and a treacherous one.
