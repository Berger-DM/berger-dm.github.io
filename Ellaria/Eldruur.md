# Eldruur, the Veiled Flame

## Ancient Origins
Eldruur is a primordial being, existing long before the first mortal creatures began to shape the lands. Its origins lie in the primordial forces that birthed the world—an entity born from the very elements of fire, earth, and sky. Eldruur’s existence predates the rise of kingdoms, the birth of civilizations, and the chaos that now roils the continent. To mortal eyes, it is an enigma, a figure whose history is woven into the fabric of creation itself. It does not belong to the world of today but stands as a sentinel from a time long past, watching over a land that has forgotten the harmony it once knew.

## A Force of Balance
Eldruur’s purpose is not one of conquest, nor is it one of tyranny. It is a force of balance—an eternal guardian who shaped the very laws of nature and order. For countless eons, it ensured that the forces of creation and destruction remained in equilibrium, that the natural cycles of life and death, fire and water, storm and stillness played out as they were meant to. But the bloodshed and chaos of the current age have driven it to weariness. Eldruur views the constant warfare, the endless conflict between nations, and the suffering of mortals as a distortion of the world’s original design. It seeks to end the wars, not through domination, but by guiding mortals toward an understanding of peace and stability—however long it may take.

## Timeless Wisdom and Long-Term Goals
Eldruur’s mind is vast, operating on a scale that transcends mortal understanding. It sees time in vast, sweeping arcs—centuries and millennia are but fleeting moments in its perception. The dragon does not concern itself with the small victories or defeats that mortals bicker over, for it is thinking far ahead, beyond the end of the endless wars. Its ultimate goal is to create a sanctuary—an untouched haven where peace can flourish, far away from the fires of war. This sanctuary, however, will not emerge until the right conditions have been met. Eldruur knows it may take generations for mortals to change their ways, and it is willing to wait for them to prove themselves worthy.

## Melded to the Earth: A Hidden Power
Eldruur’s true physical form is bound to the earth itself, a part of the very landscape it once helped shape. Its immense body lies dormant beneath the earth, entwined with the deep, ancient roots of mountains, the heart of volcanoes, and the cores of the world’s greatest forests. It does not reveal itself easily, only emerging in times of cataclysm—when the world itself faces annihilation or when the forces of destruction threaten to unmake all that exists. When it does stir, it is like an earthquake or a volcanic eruption—a force of nature that reshapes the world around it.

However, Eldruur is not always so grandiose in its manifestations. Instead, it can subtly project its presence through its agents. Its silhouette can be seen, faint and ethereal, through the dreams and visions of its most faithful servants. These apparitions are a fraction of Eldruur’s true power, a mere whisper of its vast influence. But they are not without consequence—the vessels through which Eldruur manifests suffer the toll of channeling such power, their bodies and minds pushed to their limits. Eldruur takes no joy in this, for it considers its chosen agents precious and a source of pride. It speaks to them in whispers, offering counsel, guidance, and visions, but only rarely does it manifest physically.

## Relationship with Mortals and Servants
Eldruur does not seek to rule mortals directly; it desires only to guide and protect them from their own worst tendencies. It recognizes the potential for greatness in some, but it is equally wary of their flaws. The dragon is disillusioned by the endless cycles of conflict and betrayal, having seen civilizations rise and fall due to the very things mortals so often fight over: power, greed, and pride.

To those few mortals who catch Eldruur’s attention, the dragon becomes a silent patron, a force behind the scenes who quietly nudges them toward greater deeds. Eldruur may choose its champions, those who have the potential to enact long-term change, and it rewards them with power, knowledge, and guidance. But it does not give these gifts freely—it tests its agents, asking them to prove their worth before it will offer any aid. The **Drake-Blooded Mystics** and the **Ashen Ones** are the most visible of Eldruur’s servants, but they are only a small part of the web it has spun over the millennia.

Eldruur’s relationship with these servants is not one of absolute loyalty, but mutual respect. It has selected them for their unique qualities, often testing them for years before granting them its full trust. Those who prove themselves worthy are often entrusted with great power, but even then, Eldruur remains distant, always preferring to communicate through dreams, visions, and whispers.

## Manifestations and Influence
Though Eldruur prefers subtlety, it is not beyond revealing itself in times of need. When it does manifest, it does so in a way that strikes awe into the hearts of those who witness it. The silhouette of the dragon, a vast shadow stretching across the sky, may appear in the distance as a sign of its power and influence. The ground may tremble as if the earth itself recognizes the dragon’s presence. Even a brief manifestation is enough to change the course of events, but it always comes at a cost. The vessel through which Eldruur manifests—whether it is an **Ashen One** or a **Drake-Blooded Mystic**—will be drained of strength and vitality, sometimes leaving them broken and consumed by the experience.

Though Eldruur’s true form rarely appears in the mortal realm, it has an insidious influence on the world. It speaks through its servants, guiding them to act in ways that serve its long-term vision. In times of great conflict or upheaval, the dragon may intervene more directly, using its power to subtly shape the world, nudging events in its favor, but it does so quietly, without fanfare. It does not seek to dominate but to shepherd.

## Moral Standing
Eldruur is neither good nor evil in the mortal sense. Its goals are so far removed from the concerns of individual lives that it often seems indifferent to the suffering or joy of mortals. It does not harm or help out of malice or kindness but out of necessity. It believes that the greater good—the survival and prosperity of the world as a whole—must come before the needs of any individual or nation. Those who align with this vision find in Eldruur a powerful, if distant, ally. But those who oppose it, whether out of fear, greed, or ambition, will find themselves at odds with an entity that can reshape the world if it chooses.
