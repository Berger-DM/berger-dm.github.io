# Allies of the Kingdom of Aeloria

## 1. The Ironholds  
   - **Location**: The eastern mountains, known for their vast fortresses and intricate network of mines.  
   - **Culture**: Proud, traditional, and fiercely independent. The dwarves are known for their masterful craftsmanship in weaponry, armor, and engineering.  
   - **Historical Context**: The Ironholds were once part of a powerful alliance of sovereign states. However, they were divided during the Theocratic Imperium's expansion and fell into isolation. Despite the fall of many dwarven strongholds, some remain in defiance of the Imperium’s reach.  
   - **Alliance Motive**: The dwarves see Aeloria as a valuable ally in their struggle for independence and in their shared desire to preserve their ancient ways. They may also appreciate the kingdom’s strategic approach, respecting Aeloria's ability to plan and avoid unnecessary conflict. Together, they can create a strong defensive alliance with mutual benefits.  
   - **Key Characteristics**: Masters of stone and metalwork, expert tacticians, and stalwart defenders. Their fortress-cities are impregnable, and their armies are built around strongholds and siege tactics.

## 2. The [[Riven Shards]]  
   - **Location**: A fractured, war-torn land to the north, where once a prosperous kingdom stood. Now reduced to a collection of warring city-states.  
   - **Culture**: A people with a history of independence and wealth, now living in a fractured state. They have lost much of their former glory but still retain a fierce will to resist external control.  
   - **Historical Context**: The Riven Shards were crushed by the Theocratic Imperium in a series of brutal campaigns. Though the kingdom itself was obliterated, many of its noble houses and cities survived in fragmented form, refusing to bow to the Theocratic Imperium's rule.  
   - **Alliance Motive**: The survivors of the Riven Shards are desperate to regain their former strength and will ally with Aeloria, whose foresight can help guide them toward reclaiming what they lost. Additionally, both factions share a common enemy in the Imperium.  
   - **Key Characteristics**: Resilient and resourceful, the people of the Riven Shards are skilled in guerrilla tactics and managing difficult terrain. Their culture emphasizes survival above all else, but they still retain a desire for unity and restoration.

## 3. The Fallen Elven Enclaves  
   - **Location**: The deep forests to the west, remnants of once-proud elven cities now hidden away in the shadows of their lost glory.  
   - **Culture**: The elves have a rich history and deep connection to nature and magic. They are highly intelligent, long-lived, and adept in the arts of magic and diplomacy.  
   - **Historical Context**: The elven enclaves were among the first sovereign states to fall to the Theocratic Imperium. After their cities were razed and their people scattered, they retreated deep into their forested sanctuaries, shunning most contact with the outside world. Over time, their influence has waned.  
   - **Alliance Motive**: The elves see Aeloria as an ally that values strategy, foresight, and sovereignty. Their shared interest in opposing the Theocratic Imperium makes them potential allies, especially since Aeloria’s ability to foresee the future could provide much-needed guidance for the elven people as they attempt to rebuild.  
   - **Key Characteristics**: Masters of magic, archery, and stealth, the elves are capable of operating from the shadows and striking from afar. They excel in arcane arts, nature magic, and guerrilla tactics, making them invaluable allies in warfare and subterfuge.

Though they have come a long way from their tribal beginnings, they still maintain some of the values from their early days. They have long resisted the expansion of the Theocratic Imperium, holding a deep grudge against its aggressive campaigns.  
   - **Alliance Motive**: The Freeholds of the Raging Dawn respect Aeloria’s ability to foresee and plan, aligning with their emphasis on strength and survival.
