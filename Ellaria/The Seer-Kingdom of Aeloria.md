# The Seer-Kingdom of Aeloria

The Kingdom of Aeloria is a land of stability amidst the chaos of surrounding territories. Led by a Seer-Monarch, it is a realm defined by wisdom, strategy, and the belief in foresight. The kingdom resists the encroaching influence of the Theocratic Imperium, utilizing its advantage of strategic foresight and the unshakable belief in the guidance of the royal bloodline's seers.

## Core Beliefs and Ideology

- **The Seer’s Guidance**: The ruling monarch of Aeloria, known as the Seer-Monarch, is chosen through the birth of a mark—a sign of their potential to lead. This mark is unique to the royal family and identifies the individual who will take the throne. However, the Seer-Monarch is not a solitary seer. All members of the royal family who possess the ability to experience visions are collectively known as the **Seer Scions**. These visions, though not divine in origin, offer crucial foresight that guides the kingdom's decisions. The Seer Scions’ abilities are essential for understanding the larger prophetic picture, making them invaluable strategists.

- **Fate and Free Will**: The people of Aeloria believe that fate plays a key role in shaping the world. While free will exists, the royal family teaches that individuals must align themselves with fate’s guidance to achieve true prosperity. The Kingdom of Aeloria values strategic planning and foresight, and its leaders emphasize careful decision-making.

- **The Balance of Forces**: While the kingdom is not inherently hostile toward other powers, it is steadfast in maintaining its independence. The Seer-Monarch’s role is seen as a neutral mediator in global politics, and Aeloria will only act when its sovereignty or the balance of power is at stake.

## The Royal Family and Their Visions

- **The Seer Scions**: All members of the royal family who possess the ability to have visions are known as the **Seer Scions**. These individuals work together to interpret the fragmented visions they receive, creating a collective understanding of the future. They serve as key strategic advisors to the Seer-Monarch and assist in major decisions regarding the kingdom’s future.

- **Shared Prophecy**: The royal family’s visions are shared and interpreted together, each vision adding to the broader narrative of the future. These visions serve as both a guide and a warning, and it is only through unity that the family can understand the full scope of their prophecies. As a result, maintaining unity within the family is essential for the kingdom’s stability.

- **Rituals of Unity**: Once a year, the royal family gathers in the **Rite of Foresight**, a sacred event where they share their most recent visions and come together to align their strategic decisions. This ritual strengthens the prophetic bond between family members, ensuring that their plans for the kingdom align with the guidance they receive.
